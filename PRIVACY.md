# Typeers — Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 19, 2026

## 1. Overview

Typeers is a typing game built on Reddit's Devvit platform. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## 2. Data We Collect

All data is stored using Reddit's built-in Redis storage and is associated with your Reddit username. We collect:

- **Gameplay data**: Scores, words typed, accuracy, WPM, max combo, and game completion status.
- **Leaderboard data**: Your best scores for daily challenges and weekly tournaments.
- **User-generated content**: Custom levels you create (title, words, creator name).
- **Golden Challenge data**: If you create a challenge — title, creator name, message, rewards, tier, and analytics (play count, completion rate, claim count). If you play a challenge — whether you played it and which rewards you claimed.
- **Vault data**: Rewards you have claimed from Golden Challenges.
- **Token balance**: Your purchased challenge tokens (golden, diamond, legendary).
- **Purchase records**: Order IDs for payment idempotency (no financial details are stored by the app — all payment processing is handled by Reddit).

## 3. Data We Do NOT Collect

- No email addresses, real names, phone numbers, or physical addresses.
- No financial or payment card information (handled entirely by Reddit).
- No device identifiers, IP addresses, or location data.
- No data from outside the Typeers app.
- No cookies or tracking pixels.

## 4. How We Use Your Data

- Display leaderboards and rankings.
- Track your personal stats and game history.
- Enforce once-per-user play limits on Golden Challenges.
- Deliver rewards to your vault when you claim them.
- Provide analytics dashboards to Golden Challenge creators (aggregate data only — creators see play counts and claim counts, not individual usernames).
- Prevent duplicate purchases via order ID tracking.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not share your data with any third parties. All data remains within Reddit's infrastructure.

Golden Challenge creators can see aggregate analytics (total plays, completions, claims) but cannot see individual player identities or personal data.

## 6. Data Retention

- Leaderboard data expires automatically (daily: 7-day TTL, weekly tournaments: 14-day TTL).
- Golden Challenge data expires when the challenge expires (7, 30, or 90 days depending on tier).
- User stats and vault items persist as long as the app is installed on the subreddit.
- If the app is uninstalled from a subreddit, all associated Redis data is removed by the platform.

## 7. Your Rights

- You can view your stats, vault, and game history within the app at any time.
- To request data deletion, contact us via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/AbinjithTK/Typeers/issues) or message the subreddit moderators.
- Since all data is tied to your Reddit account, deleting your Reddit account will disassociate your data.

## 8. Children's Privacy

Typeers does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app is subject to Reddit's age requirements.

## 9. Changes

We may update this privacy policy at any time. Continued use of Typeers constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
