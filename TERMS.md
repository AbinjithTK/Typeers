# Typeers — Terms & Conditions

Last updated: February 13, 2026

## 1. Overview

Typeers is a typing game built on Reddit's Devvit platform. By using Typeers, you agree to these terms alongside Reddit's [User Agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement) and [Devvit Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms).

## 2. In-App Purchases

Typeers offers optional in-app purchases using Reddit Gold:
- **Golden Challenge Token** (25 Gold) — Create a Golden Challenge
- **Diamond Challenge Token** (100 Gold) — Create a Diamond Challenge
- **Legendary Challenge Token** (500 Gold) — Create a Legendary Challenge

All purchases are consumable tokens used to create community reward challenges. Tokens are non-transferable and tied to your Reddit account.

## 3. Refunds

Refund requests are handled through Reddit's standard refund process. If a refund is processed, the corresponding token will be revoked from your account.

## 4. Golden Challenges

- Challenges require moderator approval before going live.
- Challenges expire after their configured duration (7, 30, or 90 days depending on tier).
- Reward claims are limited per challenge. Once the maximum is reached, no further rewards can be claimed.
- We reserve the right to remove challenges that violate Reddit's content policies.

## 5. User-Generated Content

- Custom levels and challenges you create are visible to other users in the subreddit.
- You retain ownership of your content but grant a license for it to be displayed within the app.
- Do not include offensive, misleading, or harmful content in challenges or levels.

## 6. Data

Typeers stores gameplay data (scores, stats, levels, challenge data) using Reddit's Redis storage. No data is shared with third parties. All data is associated with your Reddit username.

## 7. Disclaimer

Typeers is provided "as is" without warranties. We are not responsible for any losses related to in-app purchases, gameplay, or reward claims.
